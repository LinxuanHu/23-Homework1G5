advantages
    1. solve certain problems more efficient
    2. unique properities superposition and entanglement
    
limitation of quantum computer
    1. noise and error
    2. quantum volumn is limited
    3. complex computing is challenging because qubit cn lost it's properties
    4. lack of environment
