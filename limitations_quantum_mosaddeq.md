Limitations:
The limitations of this approach are substantial:

	1. Quantum computers are not designed for simple classical arithmetic operations like subtraction. This is a highly inefficient way to perform subtraction.
	2. Quantum circuits introduce a significant amount of overhead, making them impractical for basic arithmetic.
	3. Quantum computers are noisy and error-prone, which further exacerbates the inefficiency.
	4. Quantum computers have limited qubits, and using them for basic arithmetic consumes valuable resources.
	
In summary, while it's possible to implement subtraction using quantum gates, it's not a practical or efficient approach. Quantum computers are better suited for solving complex problems that leverage their unique quantum properties.
